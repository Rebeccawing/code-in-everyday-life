# code-in-everyday-life

this repository will cover my simple and trifle code in everyday life and my latex files for my homework.

The language and softwares I use includes MATLAB, SAS and so on.

For example, sometimes I use codes to simplify some daily tasks and make plans.

Also I add my three papers in the American mathematical modeling contest in it.
